<h1>About IT Cast: how we document the IT movie cast accurately</h1>

<section id="mission">
<h2>Our mission</h2>
<p>IT Cast exists to provide a clear, reliable, and internationally accessible reference for the <strong>IT movie cast</strong> across both IT Chapter One (2017) and IT Chapter Two (2019). Whether you're researching <strong>Stephen King IT actors</strong>, verifying credits for the Losers Club ensemble, or exploring how the <strong>IT film characters</strong> map to their performers, this site offers factual, well-sourced information without hype or speculation.</p>
<p>We recognise that film credits can vary by region, release format, and database. Our goal is to cut through inconsistencies by cross-referencing reputable sources and presenting the <strong>IT remake actors list</strong> in a format that serves students, journalists, fans, and researchers worldwide. We focus on accuracy, clarity, and accessibility, ensuring that every visitor—regardless of their familiarity with <strong>horror film casting</strong>—can find the information they need quickly and confidently.</p>
<p>This site does not cover rumours, unverified casting news, or subjective rankings. Instead, we document the ensemble as it appears in the finished films, supported by authoritative references and a commitment to editorial integrity.</p>
</section>

<section id="method">
<h2>Method: how we verify credits</h2>
<p>Every cast member listed on IT Cast is verified through a multi-step process. We begin by consulting official studio materials when available, including press kits, end credits, and promotional documentation. We then cross-check these details against reputable film databases, encyclopedic references, and established media outlets with editorial oversight.</p>
<p>When discrepancies arise—such as variations in character name spelling or actor credit order—we prioritise the most stable and widely cited sources. We do not rely on user-generated content alone, nor do we publish casting information based solely on social media announcements or unverified industry gossip.</p>
<p>Our editorial standard is simple:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Accuracy over speed. We would rather take the time to verify a credit properly than publish incomplete or misleading information.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This approach ensures that IT Cast remains a trustworthy resource for anyone seeking factual information about the <strong>IT cast</strong>, from academic researchers to casual viewers revisiting the films.</p>
